# How do you want to deliver chatmessages?
# - default -> This mode is simply global without any dependencies
# - defaultRanged -> This mode is without any dependencies and only shows a chatmessage to people within a certain
#                     radius you can define later
# - luckpermsSimple -> this mode uses luckperms to determine the format (with prefixes & suffixes)
# - luckpermsRanged -> Local-chat! This mode uses luckperms to determine the format (with prefixes & suffixes) and
#                       only shows this to people within a certain radius you can define later

# All the really important stuff is ABOVE this :)
# Still enough details to go though

# What should the radius be? (if you have selected a ranged chatmethod)
# We calculate this in the amount of blocks from the player
